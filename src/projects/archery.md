A **bow** and arrow are not what you would think of as must-have accessories in an urban environment. But everyone needs to get out some aggression on friends and loved ones from time to time. An empty lot and a couple of scissor lifts can be outfitted to create a large-scale analog video game â€“ but unlike Duck Hunt, you get to aim at your *friends*!
